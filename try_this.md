# Try this

Now that you have a better idea about what Node JS are try to install and use some modules.

These modules to try out is:

* [text-animation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-animation)
* [figlet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet)

Be sure to create a `NarrativeWorkbook` folder in your projects folder.

* in that create a `modules101` folder
* then type `npm init` - follow along, you will need to press enter a few times, you can change the defaults if you like
* in the `modules101` folder there should be package.json file - see what it looks like.
* node install the figlet module using this command: `npm install --save figlet`
* check how the package file changed
* now write a program using the figlet module to display 'codeX is cool!'
* take a look on the figlet npmjs.org page to see how to use it.
* Now use the text-animation module and animate 'codeX is cool'. Pro-tip: you'll need to install it first
